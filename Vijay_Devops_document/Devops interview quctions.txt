==================================================

1: What is AWS IAM, and why is it important?

A: AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) is a service provided by Amazon Web Services that helps you control access to your AWS resources. It allows you to manage user identities, permissions, and policies. IAM is important because it enhances security by ensuring that only authorized individuals or entities have access to your AWS resources, helping you enforce the principle of least privilege and maintain a secure environment.


2: What is the difference between IAM users and IAM roles?

A: IAM users represent individual people or entities that need access to your AWS resources. They have their own credentials and are typically associated with long-term access. On the other hand, IAM roles are used to grant temporary access to AWS resources, usually for applications or services. Roles have associated policies and can be assumed by trusted entities to access resources securely.


3: What are IAM policies, and how do they work?

A: IAM policies are JSON documents that define permissions. They specify what actions are allowed or denied on AWS resources and can be attached to IAM users, groups, or roles. Policies control access by matching the actions requested by a user or entity with the actions allowed or denied in the policy. If a requested action matches an allowed action in the policy, access is granted; otherwise, it is denied.


4: What is the principle of least privilege, and why is it important in IAM?

A: The principle of least privilege states that users should be granted only the permissions necessary to perform their tasks and nothing more. It is important in IAM because it minimizes the risk of unauthorized access and limits the potential damage that could be caused by a compromised account. Following the principle of least privilege helps maintain a secure environment by ensuring that users have only the permissions they need to perform their job responsibilities.


5: What is an AWS managed policy?

A: An AWS managed policy is a predefined policy created and managed by AWS. These policies cover common use cases and provide predefined permissions for specific AWS services or actions. AWS managed policies are maintained and updated by AWS, ensuring they stay up to date with new AWS services and features. They can be attached to IAM users, groups, or roles in your AWS account.

 
6. What is EC2, and why is it important?

A)  Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
- Access reliable, scalable infrastructure on demand. Scale capacity within minutes with SLA commitment of 99.99% availability.
- Provide secure compute for your applications. Security is built into the foundation of Amazon EC2 with the AWS Nitro System.
- Optimize performance and cost with flexible options like AWS Graviton-based instances, Amazon EC2 Spot instances, and AWS Savings Plans.



9) What is the VPC ?

A)  Imagine you want to set up a private, secure, and isolated area in the cloud where you can run your applications and store your data. This is where a VPC comes into play.

A VPC is a virtual network that you create in the cloud. It allows you to have your own private section of the internet, just like having your own network within a larger network. Within this VPC, you can create and manage various resources, such as servers, databases, and storage.

Think of it as having your own little "internet" within the bigger internet. This virtual network is completely isolated from other users' networks, so your data and applications are secure and protected.

Just like a physical network, a VPC has its own set of rules and configurations. You can define the IP address range for your VPC and create smaller subnetworks within it called subnets. These subnets help you organize your resources and control how they communicate with each other.

To connect your VPC to the internet or other networks, you can set up gateways or routers. These act as entry and exit points for traffic going in and out of your VPC. You can control the flow of traffic and set up security measures to protect your resources from unauthorized access.

With a VPC, you have control over your network environment. You can define access rules, set up firewalls, and configure security groups to regulate who can access your resources and how they can communicate.


10) Network Access Control List (NACL)

A)    A Network Access Control List is a stateless firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level. It operates at the IP address level and can allow or deny traffic based on rules that you define. NACLs provide an additional layer of network security for your VPC.
   

11) Security Group

A)   A security group acts as a virtual firewall for instances (EC2 instances or other resources) within a VPC. It controls inbound and outbound traffic at the instance level. Security groups allow you to define rules that permit or restrict traffic based on protocols, ports, and IP addresses.
